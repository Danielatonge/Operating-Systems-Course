What is the difference between a physical and a virtual address?

Physical addresses refer to hardware addresses of physical memory while virtual
 addresses refer to the virtual store viewed by the process.
In addition, virtual addresses might be the same as physical addresses and also they
might be different, in which case virtual addresses will be mapped into physical
addresses with the help of a Memory Management Unit (MMU).
